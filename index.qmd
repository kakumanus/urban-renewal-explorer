This project examines the lasting impact of mid-20th century urban renewal policies on Cincinnati's street networks and neighborhoods. Between the 1950s and 1970s, large-scale infrastructure projects—including interstate highway construction and urban redevelopment—fundamentally reshaped the urban fabric of American cities. This website documents what was lost and explores the ongoing effects on connectivity and community.

## Navigate The Project Website
