# Introduction
A lot of dense urban neighborhoods in the United States were decimated by policies of Urban Renewal in the 1950s and 60s. These initiatives often involved constructing expanded roads, interstate highways, and other public works, but caused immense displacement of existing communities.

Prominent examples in cities such as Boston, New York City, and Pittsburgh have been widely studied and critiqued in works like Root Shock by Mindy Thompson-Fullilove and The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs. In this report, I turn attention to a lesser-known case: the West End of Cincinnati, Ohio, exploring how similar policies impacted its urban fabric and communities.

I focus on three primary data sources: aerial imagery from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from the 1920s and 1930s, and historical Census records. Using these sources and tools from Python, including OSMnx, I illustrate the loss of street connectivity, analyze socioeconomic trends, and highlight persistent barriers to revitalization in the West End.

# Methodology

## Census Data & Longitudinal Tract Database

### Sources
To analyze the socioeconomic evolution of Cincinnati’s urban core, I utilized data from the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB) provided by Brown University. Tracking socioeconomic shifts from 1970 to the present poses a significant spatial challenge: Census tract boundaries are redrawn every decade to reflect population changes, making direct longitudinal comparisons difficult.

The LTDB addresses this by standardizing historical Census data from 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 into 2010 Census tract boundaries using interpolation and cross-walk weights. This standardization allows for a somewhat consistent comparison of variables like median household income and racial composition across ~45 years of Cincinnati's history.

For modern context (2021), I supplemented this with American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates retrieved via the Census Bureau API.

### Processing
For 2021 5-year ACS estimates, the process was quite straightforward. I created a set of visualizations which can be viewed in the results section below.

For the LTDB, since it does not offer a public API, the data processing workflow required several manual and programmatic steps.

**Data Processing**: Raw CSV files containing decennial estimates were downloaded and parsed. Using the LTDB codebook, I mapped inconsistent header formats (which vary by release year) to a standardized schema. For instance, household income variables were mapped to common income columns across all dataframes.

**Spatial Filtering**: To focus the analysis on the study area, I used pygris to retrieve the 2010 TIGER/Line shapefiles for Hamilton County, Ohio. The tabular LTDB data was then filtered to include only tracts corresponding to the county FIPS code (39061).

**Spatial Join & Neighborhood Clipping**: Using Cincinnati’s Statistical Neighborhood Approximation (SNA) boundaries, I performed a spatial join to identify which tracts fell within my primary focus areas: the West End, Queensgate, and Over-the-Rhine.

**Interactive Visualization**: The final processed datasets were integrated into an interactive Folium map. To optimize user experience, I utilized a radio-button layer control system. This allows users to toggle between decades while maintaining a consistent geographic reference.

## Sandborn Maps

### Sources

Historical Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps served as a data source for this project, providing highly detailed overviews of the study area from the early 20th century. Accessing these documents through the [Cincinnati Public Library digital collection](https://digital.cincinnatilibrary.org/digital/collection/p16998coll9/id/11099/rec/1) and the [Ohio Web Library](https://sanborn.ohioweblibrary.org/), the maps were used to roughly reconstruct the historic street grid. The maps also provided insights on the neighborhood's fabric by noting uses of certain buildings, such as churches and businesses (factories, gas stations, etc) that existed in the area prior to urban renewal.

## Census Data & Longitudinal Tract Database

For contemporary data analysis, I created a few visualizations of Cincinnati's census tracts, neighborhood boundaries, and median household income. These are presented below.
