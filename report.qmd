# Introduction
A lot of dense urban neighborhoods in the United States were decimated by policies of Urban Renewal in the 1950s and 60s. These initiatives often involved constructing expanded roads, interstate highways, and other public works, but caused immense displacement of existing communities.

Prominent examples in cities such as Boston, New York City, and Pittsburgh have been widely studied and critiqued in works like Root Shock by Mindy Thompson-Fullilove and The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs. In this report, I turn attention to a lesser-known case: the West End of Cincinnati, Ohio, exploring how similar policies impacted its urban fabric and communities.

I focus on three primary data sources: aerial imagery from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from the 1920s and 1930s, and historical Census records. Using these sources and tools from Python, including OSMnx, I illustrate the loss of street connectivity, analyze socioeconomic trends, and highlight persistent barriers to revitalization in the West End.
