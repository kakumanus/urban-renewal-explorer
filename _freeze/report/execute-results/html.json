Showing barriers to revitalization.\"\nauthor: \"Sujanesh Kakumanu\"\ndate: December 12 2025\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\njupyter: geospatial\n---\n\nNext Steps in Priority Order:\n1. Complete the Network Analysis (satisfies OSMnx requirement)\n\nDownload current Cincinnati street network using OSMnx for your study area\nCalculate network metrics for BOTH networks:\n\nBetweenness centrality\nCloseness centrality\nNetwork density\nAverage street segment length\n\n\nIdentify which \"missing streets\" were most critical to connectivity\nCalculate how much longer trips are now between key points\n\n2. Add Census Data Analysis (satisfies 3+ data sources + clustering)\n\nPull 1940/1950 census data for your area (NHGIS is great for this)\nPull current census data (use census API - satisfies API requirement!)\nIdentify those \"mirror neighborhoods\" you mentioned\nUse scikit-learn clustering (k-means or DBSCAN) to find neighborhoods with similar characteristics to what was lost\nCompare socioeconomic indicators between destroyed areas and surviving \"mirror\" neighborhoods\n\n3. Create Interactive Visualizations\n\nFolium map with layers toggle: historical aerial, Sanborn overlay, missing streets, current streets\nBefore/after network comparison\nCensus data choropleth maps showing the \"mirror neighborhoods\"\n\n# Introduction\nA lot of dense urban neighborhoods in the United States were decimated by policies of Urban Renewal in the 1950s and 60s. These initiatives often involved constructing expanded roads, interstate highways, and other public works, but caused immense displacement of existing communities.\n\nProminent examples in cities such as Boston, New York City, and Pittsburgh have been widely studied and critiqued in works like Root Shock by Mindy Thompson-Fullilove and The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs. In this report, I turn attention to a lesser-known case: the West End of Cincinnati, Ohio, exploring how similar policies impacted its urban fabric and communities.\n\nI focus on three primary data sources: aerial imagery from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from the 1920s and 1930s, and historical Census records. Using these sources and tools from Python, including OSMnx, I illustrate the loss of street connectivity, analyze socioeconomic trends, and highlight persistent barriers to revitalization in the West End.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Data Sources\n\n### ODOT Historical Aerial Imagery\n\n### Sandborn Maps\n\n### Longitudinal Tract Data Base\n\n## Python Libraries Used\n\n# Data Processing Flow\n\n# Results\n\n# Conclusion\n\n## Future Steps\n\n",
